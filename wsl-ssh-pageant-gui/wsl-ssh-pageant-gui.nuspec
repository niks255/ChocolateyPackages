    <description>A Pageant to TCP bridge for use with WSL, allowing for Pageant to be used as an ssh-ageant within the WSL environment.

The difference between the gui.exe binary and the regular binaries is the subsystem as set in the PE header. 
- The gui.exe binary is set with the Win32 subsystem so that it doesn't spawn a command line, allowing it to be launched on startup. 
- The regular binary has the console subsystem so it does launch a command line if double clicked, and will block the command line as expected.

**Note:** You may launch either binary with the -systray flag to have a systray icon whilst the tool is running, this only provides a way to quit the application.
